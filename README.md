# 🧠 YOLOv8 IP Camera Object Detection System

This project is a **Flask-based real-time object detection system** using **YOLOv8** and **IP camera streams**. It leverages computer vision to detect objects and allows users to control camera features like rotation, flashlight, and camera switch from a web interface.

---

## 📌 Features

- 📹 Real-time object detection via IP Camera stream
- 🧠 YOLOv8 and YOLOv8-seg (segmentation) supported
- 🔀 Supports multiple camera views
- 🕹️ Camera control: rotate, switch, flashlight
- 🧪 Additional CLI testing scripts included for model verification
